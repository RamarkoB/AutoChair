# AutoChair
A Website to help automate the Model UN Chair Experience

There are Four Tabs on the AutoChair Website: Delegates, Motions, Speakers and Directives

The Delegates Tab has a list of all delgates in the comittee that you can then mark as "Present," "Present and Voting," or "Absent"
The Motions Tab allows you to add new motions, and will automatically rank them from Most to Least Disruptive, and vote on them
The Speakers tab will generate a list of speakers based on the Length of a Moderated Caucus and the Speaking Time
The Directives Tab will allow you to introduce new directives and then vote on them

The AutoChair Website page will autopopulate the delegates list with a ranomly generated list of delegates, but you can add them yourself using a JavaScript List

There are two main functions you can use to interact with AutoChair, and personalize it to your committee:
clearAll(): clears the page completely
initialize(delList): intializes AutoChair with the list of delegates that has been inputted. This will also clear any current delegates
